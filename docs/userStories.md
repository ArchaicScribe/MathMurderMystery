## User 1, The Math Student
Math students, whether in elementary, middle, high school or higher education all are looking for a way to challenge themselves with math and logic problems. With these types of challenges, it can become very tedious and often dull if there isn't a type of reward or goal set before them. That is where Math Murder Mystery game will come in. It will engage the user(s) to progress and challenge themselves to achieve badges or trophies to showcase to their friends and challenge others in mathematics to see who can solve the murder the quickest. Eventually, this game will allow the user(s) to prompt other players from across the world in this game and build their social network(s) and find other "mathletes" or players who share their same interests. 

## User 2,  Someone looking to improve their math skills. 

Mathematics has a very negative connotation to it, with many individuals thinking that they are not innate "good" at it and cannot learn. This notion is false and has been proven that math is not something that is innately given, but instead is earned through practice and repetition. Since many who find math more challenging than others feel intimidated by numbers, variables, and other components of math, this app will make it fun to learn and engage the players to progress and challenge themselves to not only learn math but also build confidence with this game. This game can be a beneficial aid to teachers and parents with their child's learning and will be paramount to furthering their child's education.

**Could this app be useful on its own, with no connection to the Internet?**

**What sort of data would this app use or share if it had a connection to the Internet?**
The data that would be shared would be user's rankings, trophies, and global view of other players' awards, rankings, and status.
