## An app that will incorporate gaming elements with math problems, to help imporve the user's math skills. 

**What will your app be called?**
The app that I am proposing is currently called is Math Murder Mystery game or M^3. The reason for the naming for this game is because you are trying to solve a series of clues or hints to solve a murder utilizing mathematics and logic. 

**What is the basic functionality of the app?**
The main functionality of the app is to enhance the user's cognitive ability to work through math problems, ranging from basic arithmetic to calculus. I want to be able to have multiple levels, maps, murder scenarios to challenge the user(s) and have a progression system. 

**Who would find this app useful or fun, and when would they use it?**
User 1, The Math Student
Math students, whether in elementary, middle, high school or higher education all are looking for a way to challenge themselves with math and logic problems. With these types of challenges, it can become very tedious and often dull if there isn't a type of reward or goal set before them. That is where Math Murder Mystery game will come in. It will engage the user(s) to progress and challenge themselves to achieve badges or trophies to showcase to their friends and challenge others in mathematics to see who can solve the murder the quickest. Eventually, this game will allow the user(s) to prompt other players from across the world in this game and build their social network(s) and find other "mathletes" or players who share their same interests. 

**User 2,  Someone looking to improve their math skills.** 

Mathematics has a very negative connotation to it, with many individuals thinking that they are not innate "good" at it and cannot learn. This notion is false and has been proven that math is not something that is innately given, but instead is earned through practice and repetition. Since many who find math more challenging than others feel intimidated by numbers, variables, and other components of math, this app will make it fun to learn and engage the players to progress and challenge themselves to not only learn math but also build confidence with this game. This game can be a beneficial aid to teachers and parents with their child's learning and will be paramount to furthering their child's education.

**Could this app be useful on its own, with no connection to the Internet?**
Yes, this app will still allow players to play offline on their own. They will not be able to update their rankings or trophies until they can reconnect to the internet and update through the server.

**What sort of data would this app use or share if it had a connection to the Internet?**
The data that would be shared would be user's rankings, trophies, and global view of other players' awards, rankings, and status. 

**User Story #2**
Imagine you're a student who has been assigned some homework and you are just receiving a grade that is boring and does not have any real meaning to you whereas you can see an avatar and earn items through completing tasks and assignments. As a kid, seeing your progression that is tangible and incorporates a fun element into it where you can engage in battles with your other classmates would be tremendous fun â€” competing and gathering items that you earn through completing assignments, quizzes, and tests and show off to your friends and parents, receiving the best things you can. Achieving a problematic item through completing your work is a gratifying feeling. 

In Math Murder Mystery or M Cubed, SQL will be utilized by storing the math problems that will be used in the game. By keeping track of the math problems, their difficulties, and how they will be used in each level will all be completed through the database. Also, keeping track of the player's progress throughout the game will come into play as well. Using LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL JOIN in the program to compartmentalize and organize all of the player's data and history. Using queries, if the player wants to see a detail of their progress within the game will also come in handy for them to see and read about during the game.
