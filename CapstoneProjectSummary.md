# Capstone Project Summary

For the capstone project, I want to implement an interactive learning system that incorporates gaming and AR elements within. The main focus point for this project is for teachers to be able to interact, educate, and utilize to help their students' progression throughout the school year. Each child will be able to choose an avatar, in which they will earn equipment, items such as health potions and power-ups, which are earned through completing school assignments. After completing tasks, the teacher will be able to monitor the student's progression and their entire student roster.

If a student is struggling or not completing tasks, the teacher can opt to allow students to complete tasks for extra credit or make-up work. The teacher would be able to have this tangible object to show to their parents during parent-teacher conferences and show off what the student has earned by completing these tasks.
